"""You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money.
Write a function to compute the fewest coins needed to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

As an example:

Input: coins = [1, 2, 3], amount = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The output is 2 because we can use 2 coins with value 3.
That is, 6 = 3 + 3. We could also use 3 coins with value 2 (that is, 6 = 2 + 2 + 2),
but this would use more coinsâ€”and the problem specifies we should use the smallest number of coins possible.
There's test code below that you can use to check your solution.
And at the bottom of the notebook, you'll find two different possible solutions."""


# Solution One

# Let's assume F(Amount) is the minimum number of coins needed to make a change from coins [C0, C1, C2...Cn-1]
# Then, we know that F(Amount) = min(F(Amount-C0), F(Amount-C1), F(Amount-C2)...F(Amount-Cn-1)) + 1

# Base Cases:
# when Amount == 0: F(Amount) = 0
# when Amount < 0: F(Amount) =  float('inf')

def coin_change(coins, amount):
    # Create a memo that will storing the fewest coins with given amount
    # that we have already calculated so that we do not have to do the
    # calculation again.
    memo = {}

    def return_change(remaining):
        # Base cases
        if remaining < 0:  return float('inf')
        if remaining == 0: return 0

        # Check if we have already calculated
        if remaining not in memo:
            # If not previously calculated, calculate it by calling return_change with the remaining amount
            memo[remaining] = min(return_change(remaining - c) + 1 for c in coins)
        return memo[remaining]

    res = return_change(amount)

    # return -1 when no change found
    return -1 if res == float('inf') else res


# Solution Two

# We initiate F[Amount] to be float('inf') and F[0] = 0
# Let F[Amount] to be the minimum number of coins needed to get change for the Amount.
# F[Amount + coin] = min(F(Amount + coin), F(Amount) + 1) if F[Amount] is reachable.
# F[Amount + coin] = F(Amount + coin) if F[Amount] is not reachable.

def coin_change(coins, amount):  # [YC] This is similar to the knapsack problem. DP.
    # initiate the list with length amount + 1 and prefill with float('inf')
    res = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)

    # when amount = 0, 0 number of coins will be needed for the change
    res[0] = 0

    i = 0
    while (i < amount):
        if res[i] != float('inf'):
            for coin in coins:
                if i <= amount - coin:  # [YC] If this sub-amount (i) is too close to the amount (sub amount + coin > amount), the coin wouldn't help to build up to the exact amount.
                    res[i + coin] = min(res[i] + 1, res[i + coin])
        i += 1

    if res[amount] == float('inf'):
        return -1
    return res[amount]
