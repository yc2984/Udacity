# Solution

def heapify(arr, n, i):  # [YC] This is a down_heapify from the bottom. I think another solution is to insert the element from the arr into a new heap one by one.
    # Using i as the index of the current node, find the 2 child nodes (if the array were a binary tree)
    # and find the largest value.   If one of the children is larger swap the values and recurse into that subree

    # consider current index as largest
    largest_index = i
    left_node = 2 * i + 1
    right_node = 2 * i + 2

    # compare with left child
    if left_node < n and arr[i] < arr[left_node]:
        largest_index = left_node

    # compare with right child
    if right_node < n and arr[largest_index] < arr[right_node]:
        largest_index = right_node

    # if either of left / right child is the largest node
    if largest_index != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest_index] = arr[largest_index], arr[i]

        heapify(arr, n, largest_index)


def heapsort(arr):
    # First convert the array into a maxheap by calling heapify on each node, starting from the end
    # now that you have a maxheap, you can swap the first element (largest) to the end (final position)
    # and make the array minus the last element into maxheap again.  Continue to do this until the whole
    # array is sorted
    n = len(arr)

    # Build a maxheap.
    for i in range(n, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

        # One by one extract elements
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # swap
        heapify(arr, i, 0)
