**data structure**
I used binary search to solve this problem because the target we want to find lies between a sorted array 0 to the 
number. With binary search, we can easily find the target within log n runtime. 
**time complexity**
O(log(n)). n is the number in the function's input. The max height of the binary search tree is log(n). 
**space complexity**
O(1). The amount of space doesn't increase with the number's increase.
