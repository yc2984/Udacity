**data structure**
The data structure is an array. I used two temp variable max_value and min_value to keep track of the max and min 
when traverse the arry. 

**time complexity** 

O(n), n is the number of element in the array. We only traverse the array once. 

**space complexity**
O(n), n is the number of element in the array. We only need to hold the array itself and two additional variable max_value
and min_value in memory.
