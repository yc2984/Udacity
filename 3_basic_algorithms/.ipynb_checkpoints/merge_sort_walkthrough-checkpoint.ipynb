    "# MergeSort\n",
    "\n",
    "MergeSort is a *divide and conquer* algorithm that divides a list into equal halves until it has two single elements and then merges the sub-lists until the entire list has been reassembled in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divide\n",
    "Our MergeSort code will focus first on the divide portion of the algorithm. If the list we receive has only a single element in it, the list can be considered sorted and we can return immediately.  This is our recursion base case.  If we have more than 1 element we need to split the list into equal halves and call MergeSort again for each half.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conquer\n",
    "Once you have split the list down to single elements, your mergesort will start merging lists, in order, until you have reassembled the entire list in order.\n",
