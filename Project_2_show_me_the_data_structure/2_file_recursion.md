Array is a natural choice of data structure because it's simple and we only need to output a list of paths. 

The time complexity is O(n) because we have to traverse through all the element in the path.

The space complexity is O(n) because the worse case scenario we need to build up n stacks in order to find the file in the deepest sub directory.
