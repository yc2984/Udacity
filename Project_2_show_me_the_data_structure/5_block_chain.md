It's just like a basic linkedlist implementation with an extra hash calculation and prev_hash property. 

time complexity append O(n)
    - traverse all the node takes O(n)

space complexity of the listedlist is O(n), n = number of nodes in the linkedlist. 
space complexity append O(1)
    - we only look at one node at a time
